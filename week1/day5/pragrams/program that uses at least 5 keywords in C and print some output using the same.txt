3.Write a program that uses at least 5 keywords in C and print some output using the same. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm:
1.start
2.Declare the student details as a data base
3.Read and writethe data from use as a student details.
4. print the student database.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char student_name;  //declares the student name as a variable
    int student_id;    //declares the student id as a variable
    float student_marks;  //declares the student marks as a variable
    
    printf("enter the student_name:"); //Enter the student name
    scanf("%c",&student_name);        //Read the student name
    printf("enter the student_id:");    //Enter the student name
    scanf("%d",&student_id);            //Read the student name
    printf("enter the student_marks:"); //Enter the student name
    scanf("%f",&student_marks);          //Read the student name

    printf("the student details is:%c %d %f",student_name,student_id,student_marks); //print the student details
    
    return 0;
}
