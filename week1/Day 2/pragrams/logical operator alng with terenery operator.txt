logical operators program:

Algorithm:
1.start.
2.declares and initilises the variables.
3.By Terenery operator along with that perform AND,OR,NOT operations.
4.print the results of AND, OR, NOT operations.

#include <stdio.h>
 int main(){
     int n1=46,n2=100,n3=25,d1,d2,rev; //intialises the variables 
     (n1<n2)&&(n3<n2)?puts("true"):puts("False"); // use terenery operator along with AND operator
     (n1<n2)||(n3<n2)?puts("true"):puts("False");  // use terenery operator along with AND operator
     !(n1<n2)&&(n3<n2)?puts("true"):puts("False");  // use terenery operator along with AND operator
     return 0;
