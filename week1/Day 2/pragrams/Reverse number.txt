Algorithm:

1.start.
2.declare the variables and get variable values by user.
3.write the variable values.
4.Ectract the number one by one and print them in reverse order.


program:

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int n,t;         // declares the variables

    printf("Enter a number"); //Read the value 6 from user
    scanf("%d",&n);            //write the values 6 from user

    printf("%d \nReverse number:",n);  //enter the 6 numbers by user

    t=n%10;             //here Extracting the every number one by one 
    printf("%d",t);    //print the reversed number

    n=n/10;
    t=n%10;        //here Extracting the every number one by one
    printf("%d",t);   //print the reversed number


    n=n/10;
    t=n%10;          //here Extracting the every number one by one
    printf("%d",t);    //print the reversed number


    n=n/10;
    t=n%10;       //here Extracting the every number one by one
    printf("%d",t);     //print the reversed number


    n=n/10;
    t=n%10;      //here Extracting the every number one by one
    printf("%d",t);    //print the reversed number


    n=n/10;
    t=n%10;      //here Extracting the every number one by one
    printf("%d",t); //print the reversed number

    n=n/10;
    t=n%10;
